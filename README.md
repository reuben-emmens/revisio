# revisio

Welcome to 'revisio', the digital flashcard management tool. The goal of the project is to create a CLI application which can both import CSV data and accept key-value arguments to create flashcards.

There are ideas for more extended functionality, but these should be weighted against the benefits of keeping the app lightweight with a consistent API for third-party extensibility.
